Graaff can either be cloned from Git; downloaded as a zip or it can be installed using Yeoman.

Yeoman is the recommended way of getting Graaff on to your machine, but we'll cover all the ways below!




Graaff runs from the Terminal using Grunt. Don't worry if you're unsure what these things mean, we'll walk you through it!

To get started quickly:

* Open Terminal and navigate to your usual workspace.
* `mkdir projectname`
* `cd projectname`
* `git clone https://github.com/andismith/graaff .` to clone in to current directory
* `npm install`
* If you don't have Grunt CLI, `npm install -g grunt-cli`
* `cp -r _content content`
* `grunt`

Graaff's files are split in to three main folders:

* `content` - This is where your pages and posts live. Each folder in this directory is a folder on your site. Each file is a page. Files are `index.hbs` files, and can be opened in any code editor.
* `logic` - This is the engine behind Graaff. There's not a lot in here, as we're using [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) and [Assemble](http://assemble.io) to do most of the hard work.
* `themes` - This is where you can customise the look and feel of your site. Clone the `default` directory to make a new theme and off you go!

Graaff will eventually have it's own Yeoman generator.
