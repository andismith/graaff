Hello!

Graaff is an assembled static site by [Andi Smith](http://www.twitter.com/andismith).

We love static sites, and we especially love [Assemble](http://www.assemble.io) but it can be a challenge to get going with it if you need anything more than a very simple site.

Graaff removes the hard work with a pre-setup Grunt file with all the usual goodies baked in; and a helpful set of Handlebars helpers that allow you to access your content.
