Looks like you got the site up and running successfully. 

**Congratulations**, we told you it was easy!

It was easy, right? If you found it difficult, be sure to [let us know how we can make it easier](https://github.com/andismith/graaff/issues)!

This isn't the prettiest theme, so why not jump in to making some changes?

Graaff's files are split in to three main folders:

* `content` - This is where your pages and posts live. Each folder in this directory is a folder on your site. Each file is a page. Files are `index.hbs` files, and can be opened in any code editor.
* `logic` - This is the engine behind Graaff. There's not a lot in here, as we're using [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) and [Assemble](http://assemble.io) to do most of the hard work.
* `themes` - This is where you can customise the look and feel of your site. Clone the `default` directory to make a new theme and off you go!

### Making a new Theme Step By Step

* First find the Graaff project on your hard drive.
* Next, go in to the `src` and then `themes` folders.
* Inside this folder you will see another folder called `default`.
* Make a copy of this folder either by copying and pasting, or if you are on a Mac by right clicking and selecting `Duplicate` from the context menu.
* Rename your copied folder to what you would like to call your theme. Stuck for ideas? Why not use your name?
* Images, CSS styles and JavaScript can be found inside the `assets` folder in your theme folder.
* To make style changes, be sure to edit the Sass files, and not the CSS files. If you don't know how to write Sass, that's ok - you can write normal CSS in the `.scss` files.
* Once you've made some style changes, you might want to change the page content.
