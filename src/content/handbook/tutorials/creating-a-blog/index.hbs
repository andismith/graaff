## Initial Setup

1. Install Graaff using the [instructions](../../getting-started/installation)
1. We're going to build a blog from scratch, so delete the contents of `src/content` folder
1. Within the `src/content` folder create a folder called `_data`
1. Copy the file `logic/_data/default.json` in to your `content/_data` folder and rename it `site.json`
1. Edit the file and change the title of your site to the name of your blog.

## Creating the Index Page
1. Create a file called `index.hbs` within `src/content`
1. Give it the following parameters:
	---
	title: Home
	section: Blog
	layout: list.hbs
	page: true

	list:
	  section: Blog
	  start: 0
	  length: <%= siteData.settings.pagination.length %>
	  sort: posted
	  sortOrder: desc
