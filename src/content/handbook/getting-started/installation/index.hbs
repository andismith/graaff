Graaff can either be cloned from Git; downloaded as a zip or it can be installed using Yeoman.

Yeoman is the recommended way of getting Graaff on to your machine, but we'll cover all the ways below!


Graaff runs from the Terminal using Grunt. Don't worry if you're unsure what these things mean, we'll walk you through it!

To get started quickly:

* Open Terminal (or Command Prompt) and navigate to your usual workspace directory
* Ensure you have [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/) installed (using v0.10.*)
* Make a directory for your project with `mkdir projectname`
* Change directory in the project with `cd projectname`
* Clone the Git repo with `git clone https://github.com/andismith/graaff .`
* Install our dependencies with `npm install`
* If you don't have Grunt CLI, you'll need to install it with `npm install -g grunt-cli`
* Make a copy of the default content folder to get you started `cp -r _content content`
* Run Grunt with the command `grunt`
* By default, Graaff will be available at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/)
