You can use Grunt to deploy your site's destination folder to Git quickly and easily.

## Configuration

Configuration for deploying to Git is as simple as changing two values in a JSON file.

First, Open the `src/content/_data` folder of your website. Locate and open `site.json` in a text editor.

Find the property called `git` and modify the `repo` to match your Git repository. Modify the `branch` to match the branch you wish to deploy to. If you're using Github Pages, this will be `gh-pages`.

For example:

    "git": {
      "repo": "git@github.com:andismith/graaff.git",
      "branch": "gh-pages"
    },

## Deploying

On the Terminal or Command Prompt, go to your working directory and type:

`grunt deploy`

You may be asked to authenticate if you haven't used your Git provider for this project before.

Your deployment should complete successfully.

If you are deploying to Github pages, you can check the status of your published site by checking the 'Settings' panel of your Git repository.
